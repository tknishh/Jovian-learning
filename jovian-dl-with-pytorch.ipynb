You just need to know the following:\n\n- Basic Programming with Python ([variables](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/first-steps-with-python), [data types](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-variables-and-data-types), [loops](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-branching-and-loops), [functions](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-functions-and-scope) etc.)\n- Some high school mathematics ([vectors, matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oGJTQCy4cQ&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HCs4zPpOEdF2GuydqS90Yb6), [derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2PpRnFqnqY) and [probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk))\n- No prior knowledge of data science or deep learning is required\n\nWe'll cover any additional mathematical and theoretical concepts we need as we go along.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How to run the code\n\nThis tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai) (don't worry if these terms seem unfamiliar; we'll learn more about them soon). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" or \"Edit > Clear Outputs\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we begin, we need to install the required libraries.
